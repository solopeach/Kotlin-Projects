The icons and sounds used were the CS349 department's resources,
linked on the A3 page of the CS349 website.<br/>

Sample code from the CS349 class repository was used. <br/>

Notes about the game:<br/>
1) Hit testing calculation was done based on the bounding box of the 
image, so there might be a tiny gap in space (like the top part of the player ship) when collisions are detected.
